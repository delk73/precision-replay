# Low-Level Requirements - Replay Execution (LLR-REPLAY)

## 1. Frame Model

### LLR-REPLAY-EXEC-001: Replay Frame Variants
Replay execution shall define replay frame variants for loading operands, executing math operations, and expecting result bits.
*Traces to: HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-001, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-002*

## 2. Execution State

### LLR-REPLAY-EXEC-002: Replay Execution States
Replay execution shall define execution states sufficient to distinguish no operands loaded, operands loaded, result produced, accepted, and rejected.
*Traces to: HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-003, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-004, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-005*

### LLR-REPLAY-EXEC-003: Replay Rejection Reasons
Replay execution shall define rejection reasons for invalid execution order and expected-result mismatch.
*Traces to: HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-003, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-004*

## 3. Execution Semantics

### LLR-REPLAY-EXEC-004: Pure In-Memory Execution
Replay execution shall execute as a pure in-memory operation over a frame slice.
*Traces to: HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-001, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-005*

### LLR-REPLAY-EXEC-005: Replay Repeatability
Running the same frame slice twice shall produce the same execution result.
*Traces to: HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-001, HLR-REPLAY-EXEC-005*
